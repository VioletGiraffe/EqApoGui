# Equalizer APO Profile Manager

A lightweight desktop application for managing Equalizer APO (E-APO) configurations. It complements the official **Equalizer APO Configurator** by providing fast profile switching, streamlined profile creation, and a clear overview of all active configuration files. It does **not** replace the official GUI; both can be used side-by-side.

## Features
- Displays all profiles included in the current E-APO config (config.txt file).
- Allows enabling exactly one profile and switching between them in a single click.
- Allows quick adjustment for the global preamp. 
- Immediately applies changes when you make them.
- Lets you crate a new EQ profile with a single click.
